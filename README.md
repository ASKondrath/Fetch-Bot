# Fetch-Bot
The Fetch Bot uses your webcam to guide an RC car to chase a tennis ball. 
It requires an RC car, Arduino, and a set of red, green, and blue balls.

Your computer controls the RC remote via an Arduino. 
A color filter is applied to images from your computer's webcam to track the red and blue balls attached to the RC car. 
A video of the Fetch Bot in action and further document can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Lr388_FWCCZ0tyYzd1ZnBvNHM).
